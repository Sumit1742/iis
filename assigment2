Cryptography algorithm for caesar cipher

Aim → the aim of the caesar cipher is to encrypt and decrypt                 massage by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number. 

Theory→the caesar cipher works by shifting each letter in a massage by a certain number of positions in the alphabet 

Procedure → 
(1) Encryption —>(n+3)
How to Encrypt
Pick a Number: Choose how many letters you want to shift. For example, if you pick 3, each letter will move three places down the alphabet.
Write Your Message: Start with the message you want to encrypt.
Shift the Letters: For each letter:
If it’s 'A', it becomes 'D' (3 letters forward).
If it’s 'B', it becomes 'E', and so on.
Combine Everything: Write down all the new letters to create your secret message.
 (2) Decryption →(n-3)
How to Decrypt
Use the Same Number: You’ll use the same number you picked for encryption.
Start with Your Secret Message: Take the encrypted message.
Shift Back the Letters: For each letter:
If it’s 'D', it goes back to 'A' (3 letters back).
If it’s 'E', it goes back to 'B', and so on.
Put It All Together: Write down the letters to reveal your original message.
Result→Example
Input Message: "HELLO"
Shift Value: 3
Encryption Process
Plaintext: "HELLO"
H → K (H + 3)
E → H (E + 3)
L → O (L + 3)
L → O (L + 3)
O → R (O + 3)
Ciphertext: "KHOOR"
Decryption Process
Ciphertext: "KHOOR"
K → H (K - 3)
H → E (H - 3)
O → L (O - 3)
O → L (O - 3)
R → O (R - 3)
Plaintext: "HELLO"
Summary of Results
             Encrypted Message: "KHOOR"
Decrypted Message: "HELLO"
Conclusion → the Caesar cipher serves as a foundational example of encryption in the field of cryptography. Its simplicity and historical significance illustrate the basic principles of substitution ciphers, where each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. While the Caesar cipher offers minimal security against modern decryption techniques, it remains an important educational tool for understanding more complex cryptographic algorithms.
