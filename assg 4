ASSIGNMENT-04

AIM- To implement and understand monoalphabetic cipher.

THEORY-The theory behind a monoalphabetic cipher is that each letter in a plaintext message is replaced by a corresponding letter in a ciphertext message: 
Key: The key for a monoalphabetic cipher is a table that shows the correspondence between plaintext and ciphertext letters, or a function that computes the correspondence.
Encryption: A single one-to-one mapping function is used to encrypt the entire message. 
Symmetric encryption: The same key can be used to both encrypt and decrypt a message. 
Breaking: Monoalphabetic ciphers can be broken using frequency analysis methods. 
PROCEDURE-
1.Create the Substitution Alphabet:
Start with the standard alphabet (e.g., A-Z).
Shuffle the alphabet to create a new substitution alphabet. Each letter in the original alphabet corresponds to a letter in the substitution alphabet.
2.Encrypting Plaintext:
Take your plaintext message and substitute each letter according to the substitution alphabet.
Leave spaces, punctuation, and numbers unchanged.
3.Decrypting Ciphertext:
To decrypt, simply reverse the process by substituting letters back using the original alphabet.
4.Key Distribution:
Ensure that both the sender and receiver have access to the same substitution alphabet
5.Security
It provides security to the data by encrypting and decrypting it.
ALGORITHM- 
Example
Key:
Plaintext: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Ciphertext: QWERTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM
Encryption:
Input: "HELLO"
Output: "TPPRA"
Decryption:
Input: "TPPRA"
Output: "HELLO"
Steps to implement mono alphabetic cipher text-
Step 1-Key Generation
Create a substitution alphabet that maps each letter of the plaintext alphabet
Step2-Encryption Process
Input: Plaintext message.
Output: Ciphertext message.
Step3-Decryption Process
Input: Ciphertext message.
Output: Plaintext message.
RESULT- The result of applying the Monoalphabetic Cipher algorithm using the provided substitution alphabet.
