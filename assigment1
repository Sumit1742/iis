Assignment - 01

Aim - To be able to perform convert  from cipher text to
plain text and from plain text to cipher text.

Theory -
Plain text refers to data in a readable format, while cipher text is the encrypted version of that data. The process of transforming plain text into cipher text is known as encryption, whereas converting cipher text back into plain text is referred to as decryption.
For example -

If we convert a plain text (“HELLO”) to a cipher text . We can
shift the value by 1-
Here H becomes I
E becomes F
L becomes M
Again L becomes M
O becomes P
And the output for this is “IFMMP” this is the encrypted value
of a plain text.

Procedure -

● Firstly analyze that the text is a cipher or a plain text if
the text is a plain text .
● Now we have to shift the alphabet to right according to
the shifted value to form an encrypted value .
● And if the text is a cipher text then we have to decrypt the
text and shift the alphabet to the left according to the
shifting value.
● Now verify that your answer is correct ,by encrypting the
solution plaintext with your key.

Architecture -

For a very brief theory of shift ciphers and their analysis-
Algorithm-
For k=0:
Cipher text : JRRG GDB
Plain text: jrrg gdb
For k=1:
Cipher text : JRRG GDB
Plain text : iqqf fca
For k=2:
Cipher text : JRRG GDB
Plain text : hppe ebz
For k =3:
Cipher text : JRRG GDB
Plain text: good day

Result -

Hence the result of the above encrypted data is “good day”.
